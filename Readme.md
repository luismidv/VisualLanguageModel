Implementation of a Visual Language Model from scratch using Python PyTorch and coco2017 datasets.

The project is not complete yet, it is a pretty difficult one, and I am implementing things as I really understand:
  -First handwritten mathematical representation to know what is really happening inside.
  -Then implement it using code to get it working.

This way I really have a good knowledge and control of what is happening inside.
